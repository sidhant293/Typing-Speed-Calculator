They can also be used as a tool by those learning to read, learning to speak a non-native language, or in an environment where the audio is difficult to hear or is intentionally muted.","Frank Edward McGurrin, a court stenographer from Salt Lake City, Utah who taught typing classes, reportedly invented touch typing in 1888. On a standard keyboard for English speakers the home row keys are: for the right hand. The keyboard is called a QWERTY keyboard because these are the first six letters on the keyboard. Most modern computer keyboards have a raised dot or bar on the home keys for the index fingers to help touch typists maintain and rediscover the correct position on the keyboard quickly with no need to look at the keys. More recently, the ability to touch type on touchscreen phones has been made possible with the use of specialized virtual keyboard software for touch typing.","A transcription service is a business which converts speech (either live or recorded) into a written or electronic text document. Transcription services are often provided for business, legal, or medical purposes. The most common type of transcription is from a spoken-language source into text such as a computer file suitable for printing as a document such as a report. Common examples are the proceedings of a court hearing such as a criminal trial (by a court reporter) or a physician","Being human makes us susceptible to the onset of feelings. The role of these emotions varies. Some of them are useful while others may be harmful. The use of social media for self-expression has reached a point that it makes us feel we can say anything. This begins when we see people expressing anything and everything that come to mind.","When we see everyone else voicing their likes and dislikes, their irritations and desires we tend to imitate what they do. And because many engage in this, we think that it is normal and healthy. However, when we get used to unbridled self-expression, we come to believe that all feelings are valid. We become convinced that in real life, we should also act on our emotions and our impulses.","Or when we develop an attraction to someone despite that person being in a relationship, and because social media has conditioned us that all feelings can be expressed, we tend to think that acting on this attraction is okay. Not all feelings deserve expression. We find ourselves creating our own problems when we let our present emotions control our actions."];return e[Math.floor(Math.random()*e.length)]},p={text:m(),userInput:"",symbols:0,sec:0,started:!1,finished:!1},f=function(e){Object(c.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){var e;return Object(i.a)(this,a),(e=t.call(this)).onRestart=function(){e.setState({text:m(),userInput:"",symbols:0,sec:0,started:!1,finished:!1})},e.onUserInputChange=function(t){var a=t.target.value;e.setTimer(),e.onFinished(a),e.setState({userInput:a,symbols:e.countSymbols(a)})},e.state=p,e}return Object(l.a)(a,[{key:"onFinished",value:function(e){e===this.state.text&&(clearInterval(this.interval),this.setState({finished:!0}))}},{key:"setTimer",value:function(){var e=this;this.state.started||(this.setState({started:!0}),this.interval=setInterval((function(){e.setState((function(e){return{sec:e.sec+1}}))}),1e3))}},{key:"countSymbols",value:function(e){var t=this.state.text.replace(" ","");return e.replace(" ","").split("").filter((function(e,a){return e===t[a]})).length}},{key:"render",value:function(){return s.a.createElement("div",{className:"tc"},s.a.createElement("h1",{className:"f1 lh-solid"},"Typing Speed Calculator"),s.a.createElement(u,{text:this.state.text,userInput:this.state.userInput}),s.a.createElement("textarea",{className:"border-box hover-black w-100 measure ba b--black-20 pa2 br2 mb2",placeholder:"Start Typing",value:this.state.userInput,onChange:this.onUserInputChange,readOnly:this.state.finished}),s.a.createElement(d,{symbols:this.state.symbols,sec:this.state.sec}),s.a.createElement("a",{className:"f6 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black",href:"#0",onClick:this.onRestart},"Reset"))}}]),a}(s.a.Component);Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));o.a.render(s.a.createElement(f,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))},7:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(14)}},[[7,1,2]]]);
